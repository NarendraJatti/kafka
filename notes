Brokers - stores kafka events/message.manages and disributes messages.
Horizontally scalable.Fault tolerant.High availablity.
A server process with storage	A Kafka broker runs on a machine (VM/physical server) and uses disk storage for messages.
Key Characteristics of a Kafka Broker
Feature	Description
Role	Acts as a middleman that receives, stores, and distributes messages (events) between producers and consumers.
Storage	Temporarily stores messages on disk (but is not long-term storage like a database).
Scalability	Runs as a process (typically on a VM, bare-metal server, or container).
Fault Tolerance	Works in a cluster (multiple brokers) for high availability.

How Kafka Brokers Work
Producers publish messages to topics (e.g., orders, logs).

Brokers store these messages in partitions (for scalability).

Consumers read messages from brokers in real-time or later.

Producer → (Writes to) → Kafka Broker (Stores Data) → (Read by) → Consumer

Broker vs. Kafka Cluster
A single broker = One Kafka server (not fault-tolerant).

A cluster = Multiple brokers working together (for redundancy and scaling).

Example:

3-broker cluster = 3 machines running Kafka brokers (e.g., broker1, broker2, broker3).

Where is Data Stored in Kafka?
Brokers store data in log segments on disk (configured in server.properties):
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs


Summary
A Kafka broker is a server process (not just a VM or storage).

It runs on a machine (VM/container/bare-metal) and uses disk storage for messages.

Multiple brokers form a cluster for fault tolerance.

Need a real-world analogy? Think of a broker like a post office:

Receives letters (messages) → Stores them temporarily → Delivers them to recipients (consumers).
